# Welcome to the Case Study on Bike-Company
now this is not the actual data. That is in the other to files in this github respository. Disclaimer: the process on how I did everything is there but I just don't have the data but the link is in there and all the other steps are mapped out, I hope you enjoy.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of R
- RStudio desktop(not sure if R cloud can handle the dataload)
- Be able to change simple thing as they arise

## Just to look

- Download the brave file and it will open everything I did in the browser
- hint: thats the file ending in ".html"
